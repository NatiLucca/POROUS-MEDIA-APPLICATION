# MESH SYMMETRY
To choose between axisymmetric mesh and nonsymmetric mesh just change the input archive in run.sh :
mesh.f90 (symmetric in the left boundary)
nonsymmetric_mesh.f90 (simulates entire domain)

# MESH SIZE
In the archive comum.f90 you can define imax (number of points in the x direction).
The jmax (y-direction) is intrinsic from imax.
The parameters Px_grid and Py_grid controls the mesh refinement.

To plot the mesh and its boundaries just run:
"python grid.py"

# NUMERICAL PARAMETERS
Some numerical parameters regarding the iterations and convergence criteria are stored in:
"input/iteration.dat"

The nondimensional parameters and time parameters are  in the beginning of the archive:
"main.f90"

# FUEL AND OXIDANT PARAMETERS
Parameters regarding combustion are stores in:
"input/reference.dat"
and at the end of
"comum.f90"

To change the properties of the fuel just change the archive in run.sh:
properties_C7H16.f90 (n-heptane)
properties_CH4.f90 (methane)

# PARTIAL RESULTS DURING COMPUTATION
Running "pos.sh" you plot the last converged physical result.

# ANIMATION
Running "animation.sh" you plot every physical result stored at the folder "transient/data".
*attention: depending on the number of physical iterations this could take a while. If this happens, press Ctrl+C to cancel the .mp4 converting process and look the raw exported .png images in "transient/" (the "convert" command used can take a lot of ram).

# CLEANING DISPOSABLE DATA
Running "cleaning.sh" you delete any plots and data that you don't need to restart the computation (e.g. old transient data).
*attention: be careful, because this cleans the "data/" folder.

# ARCHIVELOG
"archivelog.log" stores what happens in the terminal emulator and show all the properties of the computation, such as current date, time and directory.
